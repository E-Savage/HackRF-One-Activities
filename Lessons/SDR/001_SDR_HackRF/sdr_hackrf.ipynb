    "The first major goal of this project is to use a Software Defined Radio (SDR) to receive and decode radio signals. Learning to decode receive and decode radio signals is a fundamental skill for any radio amateur or hacker. In this lesson, we will use GNU radio to receive and decode a radio signal using a HackRF One. \n",

    "We will be trying to capture an FM radio signal. FM radio signals are relatively easy to capture and decode, and are a good starting point for learning about SDR.\n"
